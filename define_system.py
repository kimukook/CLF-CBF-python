class ControlAffineSystem:
    '''
    This class defines the dynamic of the control affine system:

            dx = f(x) + g(x) * u
    f -> 2D column-wise vector
    g -> 2D column-wise vector

    This class also includes the control barrier function (cbf) and control Lyapunov function (clf) in a symbolic way.

    This class has the following methods:

    - Compute the Lie derivative of CLF and CBF w.r.t. f(x) and g(x):
